# Transfer Data Sets Using Ansible

This project provides sample playbooks and roles which can be used to transfer data sets between z/OS systems.

## Playbook Summary

- [**transfer-data-sets.yml**](transfer-data-sets.yml) - Handles full transfer process: dump, pack, FTP, unpack and restore.
- [**dump-pack-ftp.yml**](dump-pack-ftp.yml) - Handles transfer of data sets: dump, pack and FTP.
- [**unpack-restore**](unpack-restore.yml) - Handles unpack and restore of data sets from a terse of a data set dump.

## Role Summary

- [**dump-pack-ftp-data-sets**](roles/dump-pack-ftp-data-sets/README.md) - Holds tasks related to transfer of data sets: dump, pack and FTP.
- [**unpack-restore-data-sets**](roles/unpack-restore-data-sets/README.md) - Holds tasks related to unpack and restore of data sets from a terse of a data set dump.
- [**get-estimated-size-of-data-sets**](roles/get-estimated-size-of-data-sets/README.md) - Estimates the total amount of storage space used by one or more data sets.

## Ansible Collection Requirement

   IBM z/OS core collection 1.2.0 or later

## Getting Started

If you are unfamiliar with playbooks, you can review our
[detailed configuration guide](../../../docs/share/configuration_guide.md) or
continue with getting started below.

### Update [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) with the information about your system(s)

```yaml
# the system which initially holds the data sets
source_system:
  hosts:
    source:
      ansible_host: zos_target_address
      ansible_user: zos_target_username
      ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target
# the system which should receive a copy of the data sets on source_system
destination_system:
  hosts:
    destination:
      ansible_host: zos_target_address
      ansible_user: zos_target_username
      ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target
```

### Update the environment variables for each z/OS system in [host_vars/source.yml](host_vars/source.yml) and [host_vars/destination.yml](host_vars/destination.yml)

```yaml
# the path to the root of IBM python installation
PYZ: "/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz"

# the path to root of ZOAU installation
ZOAU: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"
```

### Update the variables in [host_vars/source.yml](host_vars/source.yml) and [host_vars/destination.yml](host_vars/destination.yml) based on desired operations

### Run desired playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml <playbook-name>
```
