# Copy and Fetch Data sets

This sample playbook demonstrates how to copy data to and from a z/OS system
using modules included in the Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
core collection.

It is a good practice to review the playbook sample contents before executing
them. It will help you understand the requirements in terms of space, location,
names, authority, and the artifacts that will be created and cleaned up.
Although samples are written to operate without the need for the user’s
configuration, flexibility is written into the samples because it is not easy
to determine if a sample has access to the host’s resources. Review the
playbook notes sections for additional details and configuration.

## Ansible Collection Requirement

   IBM z/OS core collection 1.2.0 or later

## Getting Started

If you are unfamiliar with playbooks, you can review our
[detailed configuration guide](../../../docs/share/configuration_guide.md) or
continue with getting started below.  

Optionally, you can use the sample
[host_setup](../../../zos_administration/host_setup/README.md)
to discover and create your **inventory** and **host_vars** artifacts. It should
be noted that when you use the **host_setup** it will generate a configuration
for the most common dependencies, some playbooks require more customized
configurations, in this case, you can review the sample documentation and
add the additional required variables.

### Update [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) with the information about your system(s)

```yaml
# the system where the data should be copied to
source_system:
  hosts:
    zos_host:
      ansible_host: zos_target_address
      ansible_user: zos_target_username
      ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target
```

### Update the environment variables for each z/OS system in [host_vars/source.yml](host_vars/zos_host.yml)

```yaml
# the path to the root of IBM python installation
PYZ: "/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz"

# the path to root of ZOAU installation
ZOAU: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"
```

### Run desired playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml copy_fetch_data_set.yml
```
