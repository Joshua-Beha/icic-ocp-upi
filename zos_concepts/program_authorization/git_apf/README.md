# Synchronize APF authorized libraries on z/OS from a configuration file cloned from GitHub

This playbook clones a Git repository to the user provided directory on the
target z/OS system. It then loads the master configuration file containing a set
of libraries (data sets) that are required to be present on the target z/OS
system's APF authorized list.

It then generates a list of libraries to be added to APF authorized list by
comparing the the current APF list and the master list in GitHub. Lastly, it
makes the APF statement entries in the user specified data set or data set
member.

## Ansible Collection Requirement

  [IBM z/OS core collection](https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/index.html) 1.2.0 or later

## z/OS Requirements

  [Git for z/OS](https://www.rocketsoftware.com/product-categories/mainframe/git-for-zos)

## Getting Started

If you are unfamiliar with playbooks, you can review our
[detailed configuration guide](../../../docs/share/configuration_guide.md) or
continue with getting started below.

Optionally, you can use the sample
[host_setup](../../../zos_administration/host_setup/README.md)
to discover and create your **inventory** and **host_vars** artifacts. It should
be noted that when you use the **host_setup** it will generate a configuration
for the most common dependencies, some playbooks require more customized
configurations, in this case, you can review the sample documentation and
add the additional required variables.

### Update [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) with the information about your system(s)

```yaml
# the system where the data should be copied to
source_system:
  hosts:
    zos_host:
      ansible_host: zos_target_address
      ansible_user: zos_target_username
      ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target
```

### Update the environment variables for each z/OS system in [host_vars/zos_host.yml](host_vars/zos_host.yml)

```yaml
# the path to the root of IBM python installation
PYZ: "/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz"

# the path to root of ZOAU installation
ZOAU: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"
```

### Configuration file format

    <library> [volume]
    ...

```
APFTEST.PGRM001.LIB001 T60313
APFTEST.PGRM001.LIB002 T60314
APFTEST.PGRM001.LIB003 T60315
