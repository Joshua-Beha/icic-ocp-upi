zsystem:
  hosts:
    zos:
      ansible_host: zos_target_address
      ansible_user: zos_target_username
      ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target
```

### 2. Update the environment variables for the z/OS system in [host_vars/zhost.yml](host_vars/zhost.yml)

```yaml
# the path to the root of IBM python installation
PYZ: "/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz"

# the path to root of ZOAU installation
ZOAU: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"
```

### 3. Update the playbook specific variables in [host_vars/zhost.yml](host_vars/zhost.yml) based on desired behavior
